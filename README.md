# Housing-Prices-Analysis-using-Tableau

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to amalyze the housing market in the United States from August 2018 until July 2022. This date range will show the effects that COVID-19 had on the housing market taking the median value of houses before COVID-19 as well as after COVID-19 began to slow down.
